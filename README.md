## Description

This Android application, developed with XML and Kotlin, implements a RecyclerView adapter with a custom layout, SharedPreferences for data persistence, and Gson to serialize and deserialize objects. The app allows users to enter their username, view lessons in their browser through navigation from the app, and mark them as complete, saving user progress in storage for future sessions. Interfaces are used to handle these interactions cleanly, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. Additionally, the app implements SnackBars, providing quick feedback to the user. This project showcases modern Android development practices, including custom layouts, RecyclerView Adapters, interface-based event handling, data persistence through SharedPreferences, serialization and deserialization of objects with Gson, as well as user-friendly notifications with SnackBars.

## Features

- **Kotlin**: Used for developing the application's logic.
- **XML**: Used for designing the user interface.
- **Intent**: To navigate between different components of the application.
- **Binding**: For efficient and safe access to UI components.
- **Serializable**: For passing complex data structures between activities.
- **OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.
- **RecyclerView Adapter**: To efficiently manage and display a list of data items in a RecyclerView.
- **Custom Layout**: To design a custom row layout specifically for the adapter.
- **Interface**: To handle user interactions and provide a clean separation of concerns
- **Snackbar**: To provides a quick feedback to users triggered by click events.
- **Shared Preferences**: To store and retrieve small amounts of data in the form of key-value.
- **Gson**: To convert objects to their JSON representation and vice versa.
